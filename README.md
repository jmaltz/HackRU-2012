HackRU-2012
===========

I was demoing for Twilio at HackRU and got bored in the last 90 minutes.  So a friend of mine and I threw together the Unfortunate Cookie, a Twilio powered app which gives you an ominous fortune.  We didn't really have enough time to make any semblance of a decent architecture or use mongo correctly, but it works.
